# Introduction

[Gensim](https://radimrehurek.com/gensim/) is a powerful Python library for text modeling. It incorporates a variety of models, many of which are not available in R. However, the recently developed [reticulate](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/reticulate/index.html) package provides a solution for the R user who wants to dip their toes in, without learning Python.  It allows the user to call Python code which behaves like R code, and to seamlessly pass R and Python objects back and forth. In this document, I will show how to install `gensim`, call it from `reticulate`, estimate word embeddings, and perform vector arithmetic.

# Setup

I use Python 3.6, as distributed with [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download/#macos), and once Anaconda is installed, I install Gensim at the command line, using pip. To do this, I type 
```{bash, eval = FALSE}
pip install gensim
```
at the terminal.

I assume you are using recent versions of R, and RStudio. To install thereticulate package from CRAN:
```{r, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("reticulate")
```

We'll also use the quanteda and stringr packages, to install them:
```{r, eval = FALSE}
install.packages(c("quanteda", "stringr"))
```

# Loading Gensim

Importing Gensim with reticulate is very similar to loading an R package more generally:
```{r, eval = TRUE}
library(reticulate)
gensim <- import("gensim") # import the gensim library
Word2Vec <- gensim$models$Word2Vec # Extract the Word2Vec model
multiprocessing <- import("multiprocessing") # For parallel processing
```
In gensim, we extract the `Word2Vec` object from the `models` object, using the `$` operator. Thanks to reticulate, object-oriented nature of python is changed into something R users can recognize, and we can treat `Word2vec` as we would any other R function

# Prepping the data

As an example model, we'll use the text of inauguration speeches from the `quanteda` package. we just want to extract the text we'll use to a character vector, which has 58 elements. We'll lowercase all of the tokens involved, remove punctuation, and then collapse the resulting `tokens` object back into a set of character vectors.

```{r, eval = TRUE}
library(quanteda)
library(stringr)
txt_to_use <- quanteda::data_corpus_inaugural$documents$texts
txt_to_use <- tolower(txt_to_use)
txt_to_use <- stringr::str_replace_all(txt_to_use, "[[:punct:]]", "")
txt_to_use <- stringr::str_replace_all(txt_to_use, "\n", " ")
txt_to_use <- (str_split(txt_to_use, " "))
```


# Creating Word2vec

In python, unlike `R`, we create the model we want to run *before* we run it, supplying it with the various parameters it will take. We'll create an object called `basemodel`, which uses the skip-gram w/negative sampling implementation of *word2vec*. We'll use a window size of 5, considering words within five words of each side of a target word. We'll do 3 sweeps through the data, but in practice, you should do more. We'll tell gensim to use skipgram "`sg`" with negative sampling "`ns`", rather than the hierarchical softmax. Finally, we'll use a dimensionality of 25, for the embedding dimensions, but again, in practice, you should probably use more.

```{r, eval= TRUE}
basemodel = Word2Vec(
    workers = 1, # using 1 core
    window = 5L,
    iter = 3L, # iter = sweeps of SGD through the data; more is better
    sg = 1L,
    hs = 0L, negative = 1L, # we only have scoring for the hierarchical softmax setup
    size = 25L
)
```


# Training the model

To train the model, we'll first build a vocabulary from the inaugural speeches we cleaned earlier. We'll then call the `train` object from `basemodel`, the way you would call an object in `R`. 

```{r, eval=TRUE}
basemodel$build_vocab(sentences = txt_to_use)
basemodel$train(
  sentences = txt_to_use,
  epochs = basemodel$iter, 
  total_examples = basemodel$corpus_count)
```

# Examining the Results

We can examine the output from the model, this will produce a vector 25 long. This, however, is not particularly informative.

```{r, eval = TRUE}
basemodel$wv$word_vec("united")
```

But that isn't particularly informative. Instead, thanks to `reticulate`'s ability to communicate between `R` and python, we can bring the vectors into R, and then calculate cosine distance (a measure of word similarity).

```{r, eval = TRUE}
library(Matrix)
embeds <- basemodel$wv$syn0
rownames(embeds) <- basemodel$wv$index2word
# function for cosine distance
closest_vector <- function(vec1, mat1){
  vec1 <- Matrix(vec1, nrow = 1, ncol = length(vec1))
  mat1 <- Matrix(mat1)
  mat_magnitudes <- rowSums(mat1^2)
  vec_magnitudes <- rowSums(vec1^2)
  sim <- (t(tcrossprod(vec1, mat1)/
      (sqrt(tcrossprod(vec_magnitudes, mat_magnitudes)))))
  sim2 <- matrix(sim, dimnames = list(rownames(sim)))
  
  w <- sim2[order(-sim2),,drop = FALSE]
  w[1:10,]
}
  
closest_vector(embeds["united", ], embeds)
closest_vector(embeds["united", ] + embeds["states", ], embeds)
```

This result isn't bad, for such a small corpus, with relatively few vectors. We can even do more complicated vector arithmetic:

```{r}
closest_vector(embeds["american", ] - embeds["war", ], embeds)
```

# Conclusion

Overall, this is an introduction to `reticulate`, and to estimating word embeddings with gensim. I showed how to prep text, estimate embeddings, and perform vector arithmetic on these embeddings.

This just saved my day! Thanks!

Thanks for the good work, but when I run this chunk:
basemodel$build_vocab(sentences = txt_to_use)

basemodel$train( sentences = txt_to_use, epochs = basemodel$iter, total_examples = basemodel$corpus_count)

I got this error message:
Error in py_call_impl(callable, dots$args, dots$keywords) : RuntimeError: you must first build vocabulary before training the model
